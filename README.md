<p>This is the Web application created for FromYouFlowers's Assessment.

The goal was to create two API endpoints that displayed data based off the two problems provided.

I decided to go with one of my favorite languages and frameworks python and Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and javascript for the frontend.

Once the application is open, it will bring you the homepage that displays the two questions.  

In the Navbar there are links that will route you toe the two endpoints.

The two endpoints can be reached at "localhost:5000/answerone" and "localhost:5000/answertwo".</p>


<h3>RUN PROCEDURE</h3>

<p>Once the repository has been cloned and project has been opened

1) Run __'pip install -r requirements.txt'__ in your terminal to install all the required libraries.

2) Next, to start the server use __'flask run'__ into the terminal and the server should start.

2) You will see '* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)'.  You can hold control and click the link to open it if you are in vscode.</p>




__Test Cases 1:__

All combinations of $1 including half dollars and not $1 coins should output 292.
