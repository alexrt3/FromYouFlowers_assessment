This is the Web application created for FromYouFlowers's Assessment.

The goal was to create two API endpoints that displayed data off the two problems provided.

I decided to go with one of my favorite languages and frameworks python and Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and javascript for the frontend.

Once the application is open, it will bring you the homepage that displays the two questions.  In the Navbar there are links to the two endpoints.
The two endpoints can be reached at "localhost:5000/answerone" and "localhost:5000/answertwo".



RUN PROCEDURE

Once the repository has been cloned and project has been opened

1) run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in your terminal

2) type flask run into the terminal and the server should start.

2) You will see '* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)'.  You can hold control and click the link to open it if you are in vscode.



Thank you for your time and consideration, FromYouFlowers!
